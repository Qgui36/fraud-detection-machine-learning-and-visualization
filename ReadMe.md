# Fraud Detection: Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning
## A synthetic financial dataset for fraud detection is being used in this project. The goal of the process is to perform investigations to the large data with summary statistics and graphical representations, followed by choosing a suitable machine learning algorithm for modeling. By applying random forests classifier, a high score of 0.99998 is obtained, which makes it suitable for real-world application.<br>
